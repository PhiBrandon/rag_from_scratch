  Who we are 
   At dbt Labs, we have developed strong opinions on how companies should practice analytics. 
   Specifically, we believe that: 
   
   Code, not graphical user interfaces, is the best abstraction to express complex analytic logic

   Critical analytics infrastructure should be controlled by its users as open source software 
   Analytic code itself — not just analytics tools — will increasingly be open source 
   
  It turns out that a lot of other people believe this too! Today, there are 30,000 companies using dbt every week, 100,000 dbt Community members, and 4,100 companies paying for dbt Cloud. Our customers include JetBlue, Hubspot, Vodafone New Zealand, and Dunelm. dbt is synonymous with the practice of analytics engineering, defining an entire industry. We’re backed by top investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, and Altimeter.

Boulder’s clinical teams are the leading voices in addiction medicine and industry transformation. Our technology leadership has built products and services that scaled to hundreds of employees and hundreds of millions of end-users. Our team is wholly driven by mission, recognizing that our immense opportunity is also our duty to serve others. 
  Grow with us. Boulder is a Series-B-stage, venture-funded company supported by some of the best investors in the country. Together, we're building a massive business through social impact. According to White House estimates, the opioid crisis cost the US $500 billion in 2015. A member with untreated opioid use disorder (OUD) drives 550% greater healthcare costs to payers than the average member (UHC analysis, 2019). Boulder partners with leading commercial and Medicaid health plans to bring better experiences and effective services to their members, significantly reducing costs and sharing in the economic savings we create.

   Equity: Making services and programs truly available to all, especially low- and moderate-income residential customers and small and midsize businesses who are often disproportionately impacted by societal events
   Financial stability: Ensuring a bottom line that affords capital and operational expenditures while enabling innovation and giving back to our communities

35,Orita,"About Orita
  Direct-to-consumer brands pay us, in order to market less.
 
  Well, technically, they pay us to market more effectively. And, strangely (!), that often means marketing a lot less.
 
  How? We use a lot of math and a lot of machine learning to decide which people on their subscriber lists actually want to hear from them right now.
 
  When you do this, two things happen. Brands save a ton of money. And their deliverability improves (hello inbox, goodbye spam filter!).
 
  Fewer messages sent + higher chance they will be seen = ROI goes way up.
 
  Sounds simple, right? Well, it’s not. You try getting marketers to be less market-y. It’s way easier to “play it safe” and email everyone all the time. Our math has to be that good.
 
  But you said there would be math. Yes. We said there would be math.
 
  And that’s where you come in. We need people with amazing neural networks in their heads to help program our artificial ones. You’ll be one of the founding members of our machine learning team. You’ll have a huge impact on our product, our culture, and building something great from the ground up. It will be a lot of fun.
  About The Role:  You will be on a team of ML engineers, reporting to our CTO Zack (he has a Master’s in CS from Georgia Tech) and working closely with our CEO and Head of Product Daniel (he has a PhD in Neurobiology and has built data science teams for a decade). We look like a SaaS company, but we’re really building the data science and machine learning company to support the world’s best brands.
 
  As a Machine Learning Engineer, you will:
 
   Create models that drive a ton of value for our customers
   Build a robust and scalable ML infrastructure to deploy those models in production
   Iterate, iterate, iterate
 
 
  Your Ideal Background:
  Please apply even if you don’t meet every requirement
 
   Ph.D. in some fancy field AND 5 years full-time Software Engineering work experience OR 8-10 years full-time Software Engineering work experience from which at least 5 years working on Machine Learning systems/platforms/applications
   Strong understanding of modern machine-learning approaches and algorithms
   Knowledge of Python, including corresponding scientific libs (numpy, pandas, etc.)
   Experience working with machine learning frameworks (PyTorch, Spark ML, scikit-learn, etc.)
   Experience working with machine learning infrastructures and scalable system design
 
 
   Able to prioritize duties and work well on your own
   Experience owning problems end-to-end, with a willingness to pick up whatever knowledge is missing to get the job done.
 
  Bonus points for experience in the following:
 
   Optimization (RL/Bayes/Bandits)
   Graph machine learning
   Causal inference
   Natural language processing
   Time series analysis
 
 
  Where you’ll work: Remotely in the NYC Area, with occasional in-person meetings until we get a coworking space in the future.

  About The Role and Project
  
  All of the Federal Marketplace (FMP) and Digital Experience (DX) initiatives require extensive data management, analysis and normalization. FAS has made great strides in the past two years by bringing key data into a FAS Enterprise Data Architecture (EDA) with a data set catalog. To bring data into the EDA, data scientists need to normalize data across multiple systems and sync up data fields to ensure the EDA holds clean, authoritative data that can be used by all of FAS. A good amount of FAS’s data is still held on 30-year-old legacy production systems.
  Often, these data sources do not have similar data elements, or the field names are not clear for data consumers. More current data sources such as “prices paid” data are reported in inconsistent formats and need data standards. In order to create unified digital tools for FAS schedule customers, disparate data sources must be painstakingly combined into a unified data structure. Existing data science capabilities within GSA are at or over capacity with demand from across the enterprise.
  The outcomes of this process will:
 
   Increase data quality
   Enhances data integrity for the Digital Experience (DX) project
   Provide faster delivery of quality data to customers in support of unpriced services
   Support TDR expansion and improve the useability and usage of TDR data

55,Phaidra,"About Phaidra 
  Phaidra is building the future of industrial automation. 
  The world today is filled with static, monolithic infrastructure. Factories, power plants, buildings, etc. operate the same they've operated for decades — because the controls programming is hard-coded. Thousands of lines of rules and heuristics that define how the machines interact with each other. The result of all this hard-coding is that facilities are frozen in time, unable to adapt to their environment while their performance slowly degrades. 
  Phaidra creates AI-powered control systems for the industrial sector, enabling industrial facilities to automatically learn and improve over time. Specifically: 
  
  We use reinforcement learning algorithms to provide this intelligence, converting raw sensor data into high-value actions and decisions. 
  We focus on industrial applications, which tend to be well-sensorized with measurable KPIs — perfect for reinforcement learning. 
  We enable domain experts (our users) to configure the AI control systems (i.e. agents) without writing code. They define what they want their AI agents to do, and we do it for them. 
  
 Our team has a track record of applying AI to some of the toughest problems. From achieving superhuman performance with DeepMind's AlphaGo, to reducing the energy required to cool Google's Data Centers by 40%, we deeply understand AI and how to apply it in production for massive impact. 
  Phaidra is based in the USA but 100% remote; we do not have a physical office. We hire employees internationally with the help of our partner, OysterHR. Our team is currently located throughout the USA, Canada, UK, Norway, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and India. 
  **Please only apply to one opening. If you are a better fit for another opening, our team will move your application. Candidates who apply to multiple openings will not be considered.** 
  Who You Are 
  We are looking for a driven Software Engineer (MLOps) to be a part of our growing AI Platform team. You are bold and creative, and have deep empathy for customers who may not be tech-savvy. You will design and implement significant parts of the code base and will have the opportunity to make an immediate impact with your work and guide the product and team as we grow.

91,Aleph,"About Aleph
  Aleph is redefining the world of Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A). We operate in an established software category with a multi-billion TAM but no clear winner. We’re here to change that, and our early results are self-explanatory.
  Aleph was founded by Albert Gozzi and Santiago Perez De Rosso, two technical founders with backgrounds from Stanford and MIT and experience working at top-tier companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Bain & Company. We’re backed by top VCs (Bain Capital Ventures, Khosla Ventures, YC, Picus Capital), and work with customers like Turo, Notion, Zapier, and others.
  What we’ve built so far is the most seamless way to centralize all of a company's financial data – think expenses from Quickbooks or Netsuite, pipeline forecasts from Salesforce – and bring it into the tools finance teams are already using. But the vision goes way beyond that. We’re building the source of truth for a business’ data, and ultimately the platform businesses use to make better decisions.
  We’re way ahead of schedule due to our unique approach, with barely any churn and rapid growth despite no marketing spend to date.
  We are hiring remotely across the Americas (Canada, LATAM, United States).
 
  What we're looking for
  We are seeking our first AI Product Engineer to lead the development of AI features across our web app & add-ins. You will work on determining how to best incorporate large language models (LLMs) and other AI technologies into our product. You will work closely with our product and design teams to explore the boundaries of what’s possible with AI, find innovative ways to apply the technology to Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A), and ship features with a significant impact on our users' workflows.
 
  What you'll be doing
 
   Identify new opportunities for AI solutions based on client needs, and set the direction and roadmap required to implement them
   Prototype and experiment new AI features
   Productionize and launch new AI features in our core products
   Stay up-to-date with the latest AI developments
 
 
  What you have
 
   Proven track record of 5+ years of experience in software engineering, 2+ years in AI/ML (OpenAI API integrations)
   Entrepreneurial mindset, with a passion for innovation, disruption, and driving positive change
   Strong communication and collaboration skills, with the ability to work effectively with cross-functional teams and stakeholders
   High tolerance for ambiguity and change, with the ability to jump into whatever areas need attention and learn as you go
 
 
  Compensation

5,Antimetal,"Opportunity
  Cloud spend is expected to hit roughly $600 billion this year, growing at 22.5% YoY.
  Cloud costs are the fastest growing expenditure and primary source of budgetary complexity for most companies, requiring a great deal of ongoing effort and resources. Nearly half of all companies struggle to control cloud expenses and more than a quarter take weeks or months to detect cost increases.
  Outside of just optimizing costs, companies have to hire armies of engineers whose sole job is to architect, manage, and deploy cloud infrastructure. The necessity for these large teams, even at small companies, underscores a significant problem.
  We need a new cloud experience.
 
  Antimetal
  Antimetal is changing the way companies use the cloud.
  We’ve built a solution that automates the entire cost optimization process, providing personalized savings recommendations based on each customer’s unique usage and infrastructure profile. To date, our technology has helped companies save tens of millions of dollars and thousands of engineering hours.
  Simultaneously, we are rapidly branching out into infrastructure-related products, aiming to simplify and enhance the cloud management experience.
  We’ve made the cloud cheaper to use. Now we’re making it easier to use.
  We are backed by world-class investors and are looking to expand our small team to help manage the explosive growth we’ve seen. That’s where you come in.
 
  Role
  As a Machine Learning Engineer, you will work on one of the most exciting parts of Antimetal—our AI engine. You will play a critical role in developing and implementing algorithms that detect infrastructure inefficiencies; in addition, you’ll build AI agents to automatically address these issues.
 
  You will be responsible for designing and building machine learning models and algorithms, implementing and testing them at scale, integrating them into our production systems, and monitoring their performance.
 
  You
  As our next Machine Learning Engineer, you should have at least 5 years of experience in machine learning and data science, preferably in a high-growth company, plus:
 
   Thorough understanding and experience with machine learning models and how they work. Prior work with agent-based AI systems is strongly preferred.
   Strong Python programming skills and experience with relevant libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn
   Experience using big data technologies such as Spark, Hadoop, and Kafka
   Extensive experience with at least one of AWS, Azure, and GCP
   Excellent algorithmic thinking skills

3,"Nooks Communications, Inc.","What is Nooks? 
 Nooks is a platform transforming sales reps from manual laborers to scientists. With today's technology, sales reps shouldn't need to manually write hundreds of emails, research hundreds of websites/linkedins, and make hundreds of calls. They should instead focus on the parts of their job that actually require people - talking to customers, being creative, and problem-solving. With a combination of AI tools, automation and real-time collaboration, Nooks can do the rest. 
 About Nooks 
 
  The team: Nooks is ~30 people. Engineering & product are mostly in SF and go to our office 2-3x/week. The go-to-market team is distributed across the U.S.
   
     The founders (Dan, Rohan, and Nikhil) met studying AI at Stanford, have published in top AI journals, Forbes 30u30, worked at Scale AI, Tesla Autopilot, etc.
     The engineering team has won international math & physics olympiads, has experience at Google, Facebook, Slack, Quora, Scale AI, Bolt, Snap, Flexport, and other fast-growing startups.
     The sales team have been top-performers at companies like Gong, Amplitude, LeadIQ, and Orum.
   
   Fast growth: We've grown $0 >$3M ARR in 20 months. We grew 4x in 2023 and expect to 3x by EOY 2024. 
  
 The problem 
 Sales pipeline is critical for growing companies. Many, especially B2B companies, have teams of sales/business development representatives (SDR/BDRs) or full-cycle account executives whose responsibility is to identify, contact, and qualify new potential customers. There are ~750,000 SDR/BDR's in the US alone (e.g. Airtable (https://boards.greenhouse.io/airtable/jobs/6744435002), Brex (https://www.brex.com/careers/6850017002), Databricks (https://www.databricks.com/company/careers/sales-development/business-development-representative-6933516002) and many other tech companies have sizable SDR/BDR teams) 
 In their day-to-day, SDR/BDRs spend time on 3 main activities: 
 
  Prospecting & research - identify a list of potential customers using signals like industry, size, fundraising, headcount growth, new hires, job descriptions, etc.
   Email & LinkedIn messaging - write messages to those contacts to convey the problem and pitch your product. The goal is for them to book a demo
   Calling - Live phone conversations often have higher conversion than emails because they're more personal, but there's a lot more manual work involved
  
 Most of the sales rep's job can be automated with today's technology: large language models, web scraping, automation, integrations, etc.  
 Nooks today
  
 Our customers use Nooks for most of their day (avg ~3hrs/business day). Nooks currently owns end-to-end workflows around sales calls: 
 
  AI dialer - automates the manual parts of the calling process: skipping answering machines, leaving voicemails, taking notes, logging calls, even figuring out what to say on a call
   Analytics - we record, transcribe, and analyze every call. Since these are all outbound calls with little context, these calls follow similar structure - opener, pitch, questions/objections, ask for meeting, etc. So we can answer questions like: “which reps struggle to book the meeting with prospects who showed interest” or “what are the most common objections across each of our key personas”
   Salesfloor - sales reps & managers can work together throughout the day, listen to each others' calls, give real-time advice, coaching, shadowing, onboarding, training.
  
 Teams that use Nooks often see a 2-3x increase in reps' productivity within weeks! And we're working on adding prospecting / research workflows (to-be-announced soon!) 
 (https://app.nooks.in/demoroom) 
 The role 
 Note: Exact job title will be commensurate with experience 
 We have an ambitious product vision in a nascent area - AI-powered realtime collaboration - so there are a ton of interesting technical challenges on our roadmap. We're hiring our first Machine Learning Engineer. This is a role focused on implementing ML features into Nooks. Our ideal candidate will have prior experience working in industry for a business where ML is a core part of the offering. 
 Responsibilities will include training production models to improve their accuracy for specific sales use cases. You will align our technical strategy with performance, cost and feasibility considerations. 
 Examples of engineering problems you may touch 
 These are just examples, this list is non-exhaustive, and you definitely don't need experience in all of these areas. But hopefully you find some of them exciting! 
 
  Realtime audio AI & precision/recall/latency tradeoffs (algorithms & models) 
   
    We use audio data, transcription, silence detection, and several other signals to detect whether a live phone call is a voicemail, a human, or a dial tree. Here, latency is a third factor added to the standard precision/recall tradeoff because it's important we can detect humans quickly. Our approach involves LLM embeddings, few-shot learning, data labeling, and continuous monitoring of model performance in prod.
    
  Smart call funnels & playbooks (data wrangling, backend eng, GPT-3, UX) 
   
    At what point in the conversation do my reps get stuck? What are the toughest questions that we need to address? Can I “program” a playbook so that Nooks will help my team standardize toward best-practices? We're using GPT-3 and other LLM's to turn companies' mostly unstructured call data into actionable strategies & feedback loops. 
   
  Conversation embeddings & markov models (ML modeling) 
   
    What does the anatomy of a call look like? If I say XYZ, what are the different ways the prospect might answer and the probabilities of each? Conditioned on the first half of the call, what do I say next to maximize the likelihood that I book a demo at the end of the call? Can we use LLM's to generate embeddings of conversations that we can use to cluster similar conversation patterns and predict where the conversation is headed?
   
  
 Requirements 
 
  Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Machine Learning, Data Science, or a related field.
   3+ years of industry experience, including 2+ years training and deploying ML models in production.
   Full stack ML Eng chops: proficiency in general purposes programming languages such as Python/Javascript, and with libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, scikit-learn etc.
   Expertise in areas like NLP, Deep Learning, Anomaly Detection, Transformers and Large Language Models.
  
 Nice to haves: 
 
  Background in an analytical field like heuristics, data science &/or statistics
   Prior experiences working in both startup and research environments

  About Us: 
  Cityblock Health is the first tech-driven provider for communities with complex needs—bringing better care to where it's needed most, block by block. Founded in 2017 on the premise that ""health is local"" and based in Brooklyn, we are backed by Alphabet's Sidewalk Labs along with some of the top healthcare investors in the country. 
  Our mission is to improve the health of underserved communities. Importantly, our solutions are designed specifically for Medicaid and lower-income Medicare beneficiaries, and we meet our members where they are, bringing care into the home and neighborhoods through our community-based care teams and Virtual Care offerings. 
  In close collaboration with community-based organizations, local providers, and leading health plans, we are reorganizing the health system to focus on what matters to our members. Equipped with world-class, custom care delivery technology, we deliver personalized primary care, behavioral health, and social services to deliver a radically better experience of care for every member and community we serve. 
  Over the next year, we'll grow quickly to bring better care to many more members and their communities. To do this, we need people who, like us, believe that everyone should have good care for what matters to them, in their community. 
  Our work is grounded in a belief in the power of a diverse community. To close gaps in care and advance equity in the communities we serve, we have to start with making our own team diverse and inclusive. Our ways of working are characterized by creativity, collaboration, and mutual learning that comes from bringing together a community from diverse backgrounds and perspectives. We strive to ensure that every person on the Cityblock team, and every Cityblock member, feels supported and included as a part of our community.

21,Vestwell,"WHO ARE WE? 
   There are over 30M small businesses in the United States, but only a tiny fraction of them have a workplace savings program in place. As the savings gap in the country widens, it's imperative that every worker has access to and participates in their company's savings program, such as a 401(k) or 403(b). We believe that American workers should have easy access to an inexpensive, flexible, and intuitive solution to save for a brighter future.  Unfortunately, prior to Vestwell, small businesses have been neglected and underserved, with expensive, inflexible, poorly designed offerings built on old, mainframe software. Vestwell is changing that, starting with rebuilding the core infrastructure for the modern era.  Vestwell's north star is to be the engine behind a $30T industry, powering all payroll-deducted workplace savings programs for small-to-midsize businesses, such as 401(k), 403(b), IRA, emergency savings accounts (ESA), health savings accounts (HSA), 529 college savings, and alike.  Vestwell's focus is to build the most flexible, powerful workplace savings and investment platform, delivered through the hands and minds of their financial services partners with the help of payroll provider partners. The team at Vestwell makes the hard stuff look easy, by combining the expertise of financial advice with the sophistication of a technology provider.  As a result, workplace providers are able to bestow the advice and solution employers and employees have been asking for, while growing and scaling along the way. Employers get a cost-effective solution designed for their needs without all the headaches, and employees get a user-friendly portal that helps them achieve their long-term saving goals. 
   WHY VESTWELL? 
   With backing from leading FinTech investors, as well as a growing team of dedicated professionals of strong industry pedigree, Vestwell is at the forefront of a much-needed change in a 40-year old industry. Our team believes in the mission we've set out to achieve and we are working hard to get there. We're ambitious, honest, thoughtful, and fun.

4,Strive Pharmacy,"Company Overview 
   Before we opened Strive Pharmacy we were unsatisfied with the current state of the pharmaceutical industry. Most of the current pharmaceuticals only offer a one size fits all approach and often come with unwanted and potentially dangerous side effects. We found that through compounding we can offer a much more personalized solution to medicine. 
   Through this we have been able to help patients get the results they are seeking for their personal needs. After years of working for corporate chains we took the risk and opened Strive Pharmacy. We are dedicated to providing a better experience for each customer and clinic that we work with. Come see the Strive difference. 
   Our Mission 
   We're flipping the script with personal medicine. We strive to interrupt an industry that has been closed to personalized care, accessibility, and nuance for too long. We strive to shift a reactive view of self-care and ignite a proactive baseline-shifting approach to health for all. 'The human element' is our crux and catalyst, driving all that we do, whether we're interacting with patients, providers, or practices. We're here to partner with those ready for a change. More than a compounding pharmacy, we're on a mission to positively disrupt healthcare as we know it. Strive is about more than medicine. Strive is about striving for the personal side of healthcare.

24,MD Anderson Cancer Center,"The Johnston Laboratory is an interdisciplinary and highly collaborative team of microbiologists, synthetic biologists, bioinformaticians and engineers. The long-term goal of our research is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the capabilities of microbes/microbial communities within tumors, elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving their behavior, and utilize this knowledge to engineer innovative therapeutics and advanced microbe-based technologies for cancer prevention and treatment. To achieve this, we employ cutting-edge bacterial omics techniques (including pangenomics, pan-epigenomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics) to generate hypotheses centered on understanding how specific microbes migrate to, colonize, and persist within human tumors. We then utilize synthetic microbiology principles to develop genetic systems for these tumor-associated microbes, allowing us to experimentally test and refine our hypotheses using in-vitro and pre-clinical models of disease. Moreover, using knowledge gained, we aim to harness the innate abilities of microbes to access recalcitrant areas of the tumor microenvironment and engineer them as effective delivery vehicles for therapeutic payloads.

  Who we are 
   At dbt Labs, we have developed strong opinions on how companies should practice analytics. 
   Specifically, we believe that: 
   
   Code, not graphical user interfaces, is the best abstraction to express complex analytic logic 
   Data analysts should adopt similar practices and tools to software developers 
   Critical analytics infrastructure should be controlled by its users as open source software 
   Analytic code itself — not just analytics tools — will increasingly be open source 
   
  It turns out that a lot of other people believe this too! Today, there are 30,000 companies using dbt every week, 100,000 dbt Community members, and 4,100 companies paying for dbt Cloud. Our customers include JetBlue, Hubspot, Vodafone New Zealand, and Dunelm. dbt is synonymous with the practice of analytics engineering, defining an entire industry. We’re backed by top investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, and Altimeter.
